# Learning Go by Examples

The Go files in this directory are from the site https://gobyexample.com/ to learn Go by examples.

Execute the Go files with `go run`:

```bash
go run 01_hello-world.go
```

Or, build them with `go build` and execute them:

```bash
go build 01_hello-world.go
./01_hello-world
```
